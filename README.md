ASU Digital Culture Spring 2019 Capstone Project

Setup:
  - This project uses Expo, so make sure to have it installed: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation/
  - Also install the Expo app on your mobile device
 
Start the App:
  1. Navigate into the project directory (wherever you cloned this repository to)
  2. On the command line, run `yarn start`, `npm start`, or `expo start` depending on what you have setup on your device
      - If there are any errors try running `yarn` or `npm` on the command line to install anything you are missing and then    start the project again
  3. The development server will be started
  4. From the browser on your computer you can text yourself a link to the project and click on it to open it in the Expo app
  5. You should also be able to open a simulator on your computer instead of texting a link

```
